# Netflix Remote
Control Netflix Remotely.

The solution requires a Chrome extension and an application that needs to run on the same network as the Netflix instance which you would like to remotely control.

The Chrome extension is automatically enabled when users navigate to the Netflix website.

The application is simply a background process which enables a web-based interface from which the remote control functionality is accessed.
